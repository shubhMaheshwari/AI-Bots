# IDA
	Compatively Slower than DFS 
	Espically on the middle moves because it is always returing 0 Hence always walking a dead end
	We need an Evaluator at depth == 0 to make it better
	Very slow before 60
		15 sec

# IDA vs DFS		
	Not effectve in this game

# Monte Carlo is only better for starting states not afterward
